<p class="dropCap">In a recent discussion about the internet of things, a group of friends and I entertained the idea of one day being able to wake up in the morning and walk into our smart kitchens with our breakfast served and coffee made by friendly robots. We would then be driven to work by our smart cars while we relax and read the paper. Surprisingly, the thought of this scared me more than anything. As great as it sounded, I could think of nothing lazier. I thought about how google has completely eliminated the idea of traditional research. Hours that our parents spent in libraries researching for essays would take us ten minutes with a functional search engine. Has technology made us more lazy then? Has the digital age made our minds weaker and deep thinking impossible?</p>

<h2>"Technology makes us weaker!"</h2>

<p>In response to this question, Dominique Jackson snarkily writes that in the near future, Boy Scouts will be teaching kids how to use a GPS instead of a compass. His thinking is that with every new release of technology, we become less physically active and more reliant on a screen, fearing that one day we will be the space humans in Wall-E who hover around on chairs, the epitome of laziness. Dominique is not alone in these fears though.</p>

<p>On his blog, Andy writes that technology makes us weaker socially, physically, and mentally. He points out that technology has led to less face-to-face communication. It has also allowed us to remain sedentary for longer periods of time. Andy’s gripes are very common among those who dissuade against the overuse of technology. The underlying feeling among this group is that technology allows us to not do things that we were forced to do before. Their biggest fear is that if we continue to rely on technology, we will reverse all the progress we have worked so hard to achieve.</p>

<p>Something seems missing in these arguments however. Hasn’t technology enabled us to do things that we have never been able to do before? Where would we be without the computer? Man would not have made it to the moon. Traffic would be horribly inefficient. We would still commute by boat. If technology is bad, how do you explain all of this?</p>

<p>The answer is in how we use technology. How many Netflix show have you binge watched in the last month? How many hours do you spend hopelessly scrolling on the internet? According to Reader’s Digest, binge watching may be worse than we think. Research from the American Heart Association suggests that watching more than three hours of television in a day doubles a person’s risk of premature death. So Andy’s fears were valid. Technology put to poor use can have negative effects.</p>

<h2>Our Obligation To Use Technology Ethically</h2>

<p>Technology, while not innately bad, can be abused. After the advent of the Tesla autopilot, numerous drivers were caught sleeping or texting while driving, some resulting in crashes. As a result, various authorities called for a ban on the use of the word auto-pilot in Tesla ads. The thing is, this technology was not meant to harm anyone. Technology cannot (yet) harm anyone by itself. Because of this, it is our responsibility as owners of technology to use it ethically. For example, technology is not always perfect. Computer systems have glitches. Because of this, we should always be wary when using technology that can affect other people. The whole point of technology is convenience, but when we use technology in a way that disrupts others, it defeats the purpose.</p>

<p>Put to good use, however, technology has been shown to have positive effects on its users. While Andy may have worried that technology will make us physically weak, he does not have much to fear. Technologies like FitBit and smartwatches encourage healthy living habits by keeping you on your feet and tracking sleep cycles in order to ensure a good night’s sleep. On top of this, Kristen from Gizmodo writes about the results from a UCSF study that suggest smartwatches may also have the ability to detect heartbeat abnormalities. If this is true, then smartwatches will have taken a leap beyond general fitness health.</p>
